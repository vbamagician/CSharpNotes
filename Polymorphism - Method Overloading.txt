Method Overloading: Method overloading is an approach of defining multiple behaviours to the method. 

Overloading comes into the polymorphism.

Overloading will help developer to create multiple outputs from multiple inputs. Overloading is not a polymorphism but by using method overloading technique, we can achive polymorphism. 

When input is changing and if the output also changes then it is polymorphism. 

namespace MyProgram 
{
	public class TestClass
	{
		public void test()
		{
		}
		
		public string test() //invalid because in the starting point, we have ambiguity having two same methods.
		{
		}

		public void test(int i)
		{
		}

		public void test(string s)
		{
		}
		
		public void test(int i, string s) //order of paramter matters
		{
		}
		
		public void test(string s, int i) //order of paramter matters
		{
		}
		
		public static void Main()
		{
			TestClass p = New TestClass();
			p.text();
		}
	}
}

=> Example of Method overloading

namespace MyProgram 
{
	public class TestClass
	{	
		public static void Main()
		{
			String s = "Hello World";
			s.IndexOf('o'); //output would be 4, as index count starts form 0 and input type is character type
			s.IndexOf('o',5); // output would be 7, as now counting starting from 5 character. Input type is character type and integer number from where you want to start search from. 
			s.IndexOf("ll"); // output would be 2 as input arugument type is string. 
		}
	}
}
