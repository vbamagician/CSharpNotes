Method Overriding:

- It's an approach of re-implementing a parent class method under the child class with the same signature. 

- if we want to override parent's method under the child class first that method should be declared by using "virtual" modifier in the parent class. 

- Any virtual method of the parent class can be override by the child class if required by using the "override" modifier.  

=> Example:

public Class1
{
	public virtual void Test(); //add "virtual" modifier in the method become overridable
}

public Class2 : Class1
{
	public override void Test(); //We have overriding the Test Method of Class1
}
