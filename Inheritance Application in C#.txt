	marks
	grade
	fees

Teaching Staff:

Step 3: identify the common attributes of each entity and put them in a hierarchial order. and create parent class with common attributes. 

Step 4: define the classes representing then entities that are put in hierarchial order. 

public class Person //four members
{
	public int id;
	public string name, address, phone;
}

public class Students : Person //8 members
{
	int class;
	char grade;
	float marks, fees;
}

public class Staff : Person //6 members
{
	public string designation;
	public double salary;	
}

public class Teaching : Staff //8 members
{
	string qualification, subject;
}

public class NonTeaching : Staff //8 members
{
	int managerID;
	string department;
}
