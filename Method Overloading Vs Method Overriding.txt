Method Overloading:
1. In this case, we define multiple methods with same name by changing their parameters.
2. This can be performed either within Class as well as between parent child classes also.  
3. While overloading, a parent class method under the child class, child class doesn't require to take any permission from the parent class. 
4. Overloading is all about defining multiple behavoiours to a method. 

Method Overriding:
1. In this case, we define multiple methods with same name and same parameters. 
2. This can be performed only between parent-child classes and never be performed within the same class. 
3. While overriding, a parent class's method under the child class, the child class requires a permission from it's parent. 
4. Overriding is all about changing the behaviour of parent method under the child class. 

=> Example: Concept

public Class1
{	
	public void Show(); //method overloading 
	public void Show(int i); //method overloading 
	public void Test();
}

public Class2 : Class1
{
	public void Show(string s); //method overloading 
	public void Test(); //We have overriding the Test Method of Class1
}

=> Example: VStudio

namespace Myprogram 
{
	public class LoadParent
	{
		public void Show() 
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Parent's Show Mehtod is Called");
		}
		public virtual void Test() //Change 3: method override
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Parent's Test Mehtod is Called");
		}
	}

	public class LoadChild : LoadParent
	{
		public void Show(int i) //Change 2 : Method Overloading 
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Child's Show Method is Called");
		}
		public override void Test() //Change 3: method override
		{
			Console.WriteLine("Child's Test Mehtod is Called");
		}		
		static void Main()
		{
			LoadChild c = New LoadChild();
			c.Show();
			c.Show(10); //Change 2: Method Overloading
			c.Test(); 
			
			Console.ReadLine();
